# Pokemon-Feistiness-MapReduce-Job
This Project aims to implement a **Hadoop MapReduce job in Pseudo-Distributed Mode** to determine the **feistiest Pokémon** based on their **type**.  The job processes the Pokémon dataset (`pokemon.csv`) and outputs a CSV file containing Pokémon **type1, type2, name, and feistiness score**.
